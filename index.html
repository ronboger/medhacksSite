                <h3>What is a hackathon?</h3>  
                <p>A hackathon is a place where people learn, play, and make. A hackathon is where people perform superhuman feats and solve problems in short periods of time. A hackathon is a producer of hackers. Hackathons are likely the most exciting thing you don't know too much about.</p>
                <p>But more broadly defined, a hackathon is a multi-day event where people come together, ideate, and work intensively on ideas and products.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-box">
                <h3>Why MedHacks?</h3>
                <p>MedHacks is a student-run event that focuses on innovating at the crossroads of medical entrepreneurship and technological development. By working together for the weekend, hackers at MedHacks will gain unique opportunities to learn from each other and from experts at the forefronts of medicine and technology – integrating their learning into real solutions to pressing medical challenges. At MedHacks 2015, hackers will put their creativity and skills to work to change – and save – lives.</p>

                <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
                <p>Any student, anywhere. Anyone can make an impact - hackthons produce "hackers", not the other way around. Students - both at the undergraduate and graduate level - with engineering, medical, and entrepreneurial backgrounds are encouraged to apply for a spot at MedHacks 2015.</p>

                <p>It's not about winning - it's about learning, having fun, and starting the renaissance of medical innovation! In addition, winners will be chosen by a judging panel based on criteria such as technical difficulty, creativity, and impact. Many sponsors will also give out cool prizes for hacks that excel in specific categories.</p>

                <h3>What is a Medical Hackathon?</h3>
                <p>Drawing on the popular concept of hackathons being held around the world, we are challenging innovators to design solutions to the most pressing medical issues of our day within 36 hours. MedHackers will work (and play) in interdisciplinary teams over the weekend, utilizing the unique skillset of each team member to build the best solution to a critical medical problem. Along the way, hackers will eat together, code together, learn together, and design together before presenting their finished product (together) to a panel of judges.</p>

                <h3>But I know nothing about health/coding?!?!</h3>
                <p>If you don't know about health or engineering, don’t worry - learning is a huge part of the MedHacks experience! We will have workshops on all subjects and mentors to answer questions and help out teams. Come with an open mind, you'll work with a great team, learn a lot, and most importantly, have fun.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-box">
                <h3>How will I get there?</h3>
                <p>MedHacks is able to offer a limited number of travel grants for participants coming from outside the Baltimore metro area. If you are in need of assistance in attending MedHacks, and live outside the Baltimore area, please send an email to <a href="mailto:travel@medhacks.org">travel@medhacks.org</a>. </p>

                <p>For participants coming to the Homewood Campus from other Johns Hopkins Institutions, the JHMI shuttle is recommended. The JHMI Shuttle schedule is available <a href="http://ts.jhu.edu/Shuttles/Shuttle_Schedules/Homewood_JHMI_Shuttle_Schedule.pdf">here</a>.</p>

                <p>For those traveling to MedHacks by train (Amtrak and MARC Penn Line) via Baltimore Penn Station, the JHMI shuttle stops at Penn Station and heads north to the Homewood Campus (its northernmost stop). Taxis are also available at Penn Station for the 10 minute drive to the Homewood Campus, and should cost approximately $7.</p>

                <h3>Where will I sleep?</h3>
                <p>For those coming in from out of town, we recommend you bring a sleeping bag and basic toiletries. If hotels sound better than a floor, the Doubletree Colonnade is a two-minute walk. Other hotels in the Inner Harbor area are reachable by cab. </p>

                <h3>I'm not a student, can I still get involved?</h3>
                <p>Of course! We are looking for talented and qualified mentors, speakers, and <a href="./sponsors.pdf">sponsors</a> in tech, entrepreneurship, medicine, and their intersection. We're always looking for new people to get involved, shoot us an email at <a href="mailto:info@medhacks.org">info@medhacks.org</a> and we'll be in touch.</p>
